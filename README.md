Implementation of the Pomodoro timing technique as a Slack Bot/Plugin

# About
This bot is a pretty small project from an ACM@KU Hack Night. I am currently working on this bot with my friend Liam Ormiston, who is hoping to create a slash command to accompany the bot.

I created this bot to serve as a Slack Integration for a popular time management technique know as the Pomodoro technique. I found that using external resources felt a little slow, as my primary workflow almost always includes a Slack session. With this implementation, I am able to effectively utilize the pomodoro technique directly from Slack, and receive local push notifications when it's time to take a break or start a new timing block. 

I also worked on this bot in order to continue familiarizing myself with Python's Slack client and the Slack Web API, as it is a dream of mine to work at Slack one day.

In the future, I'd like to be able to dynamically set the time interval through Slack, and add user identification in the message posted by the Bot.
